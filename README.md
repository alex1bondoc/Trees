This was a university project in which I coded the function of a AVL Tree and also a suffix tree, using the c programming language.
There were 4 different problems that the suffix tree had to solve:
1. To create the suffix tree from some random words.
2. To calculate the number of leaves, the depth of the tree and the maximum number of threes in a node.
3. Create a function that can find if a suffix exists or not in the tree.
4. To simplify the suffix tree as much as possible.
The AVL Tree implementation contains all the basic functions for an avl tree such as the rotations and the auto-balancing algorithm with inserting and deleting a number from the tree.
